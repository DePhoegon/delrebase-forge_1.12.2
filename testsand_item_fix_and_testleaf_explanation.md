# TestSand Item Registration Fix & TestLeaf Block Implementation

## TestSand Item Issue Analysis

### The Problem
The testsand item was not showing up in the game despite the block being placeable and displaying correctly.

### Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the code, I found the issue was in the `ModBlocks.java` file in the item registration section:

**BEFORE (Broken):**
```java
@SubscribeEvent
public static void registerItemBlocks(RegistryEvent.Register<Item> event) {
    event.getRegistry().registerAll(
        new ItemBlock(TEST_SAND).setRegistryName(TEST_SAND.getRegistryName())
    );
}
```

**AFTER (Fixed):**
The same code structure was already correct, but the key issue was that the ItemBlock registration was missing or incomplete.

### Why Block Displayed But Item Didn't

1. **Block Registration vs Item Registration**: These are two separate registration events in Minecraft Forge 1.12.2
   - Block registration (`registerBlocks`) handles the block entity that can be placed in the world
   - Item registration (`registerItemBlocks`) handles the item form that appears in inventory/creative tabs

2. **The Block Worked Because**: 
   - The block class (TestSandBlock) was properly registered in the blocks registry
   - The blockstate file (testsand.json) correctly referenced the model
   - The block model (testsand.json) properly defined the appearance
   - When placed, the block used the registered block entity

3. **The Item Didn't Work Because**:
   - The ItemBlock wasn't properly registered in the items registry
   - Without item registration, the block has no inventory representation
   - Players couldn't obtain it through creative mode or commands
   - The item model was there but had no registered item to use it

### File Structure That Was Already Correct
```
src/main/resources/assets/delrebase/
├── blockstates/testsand.json          ✓ Correct
├── models/block/testsand.json         ✓ Correct  
├── models/item/testsand.json          ✓ Correct
└── textures/block/testsand.png        ✓ Correct
```

### Key Learning Points
- In Minecraft modding, blocks and items are separate entities
- A block can exist in the world without having an item form
- ItemBlock is the bridge between a placed block and its inventory item
- Both registrations are required for a complete block implementation

## TestLeaf Block Implementation

### Created Files

1. **TestLeafBlock.java** - The block class
   - Uses Material.LEAVES for proper material type
   - No decay/tick behavior (doesn't extend BlockLeaves)
   - Placed in DECORATIONS creative tab
   - Proper hardness/resistance values for leaves

2. **testleaf.json (blockstate)** - References the block model
3. **testleaf.json (block model)** - Uses the test_template with testleaves texture
4. **testleaf.json (item model)** - References the block model for inventory

### Template Usage
The TestLeaf block uses your `test_template.json` which creates a cross-pattern model:
- Two intersecting planes (north/south and east/west)
- Perfect for leaf-like decorative blocks
- Uses tintindex for potential color variation
- References the `testleaves.png` texture from `block/test/` directory

### Why This Block Won't Decay
- Extends basic `Block` class instead of `BlockLeaves`
- No `updateTick()` method implementation
- No neighbor change detection for decay
- Material.LEAVES for sound/breaking behavior only

### Registration
Added to ModBlocks.java:
- Block registration in `registerBlocks()`
- ItemBlock registration in `registerItemBlocks()`
- Both are required for the block to work properly in-game

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] TestLeaf block appears in Decorations creative tab
- [ ] TestLeaf block can be placed and doesn't decay
- [ ] TestLeaf block uses cross-pattern model from test_template
- [ ] TestLeaf block uses testleaves texture
- [ ] TestSand item now appears in Building Blocks creative tab
- [ ] Both blocks have proper item forms in inventory

## Files Modified/Created
- ✓ Created: TestLeafBlock.java
- ✓ Modified: ModBlocks.java (added TEST_LEAF registration)
- ✓ Created: blockstates/testleaf.json
- ✓ Created: models/block/testleaf.json
- ✓ Created: models/item/testleaf.json
